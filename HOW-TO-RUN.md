# How to run Basalt

Two programs. One on the laptop with the drive, one on each machine you browse
from — a Windows PC, or an Android phone or tablet.

**There is no address to type.** The client finds the host on the network by
itself, and keeps finding it after the router hands out a different address.

---

## On the laptop with the drive — Basalt Host

Run the installer:

```
apps\host\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Basalt Host_1.4.6_x64-setup.exe
```

It installs for your account only, so Windows does not ask for an
administrator.

Plug in the drive and open **Basalt Host**. It lists the drives on the machine
with their labels and how much room is left. Click the one you want, give it a
name your other devices will see, and press **Share**.

That is the setup.

The window then shows the drive, the devices paired with it, what each has
moved and how fast it is going right now. Four settings live at the bottom:

- **Ask for a PIN when pairing** — on by default. A new device appears on this
  screen with a six-digit number to type on that device. With it off, anything
  on your network that finds this machine can read the drive without being let
  in, and the app says so.
- **Start when Windows starts** — comes up in the notification area at login,
  so the drive is there before you go looking for it.
- **Recognise films and series** — off by default. When on, the host reads
  through the drive and works out which files are films and which are
  episodes, so your devices get **Movies** and **TV Series** sections instead
  of only folders. It rescans by itself whenever the drive changes, so
  anything you add, rename or delete turns up without being asked.

  Underneath it, **Download posters** takes a free
  [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) API key. Leave it empty and
  the app draws its own covers instead — which is the default, because looking
  titles up means sending every one of them to a third party, and a list of
  titles is a list of what you watch.
- **This machine's name** — what your devices see in their list.

**Closing the window keeps the drive shared.** It goes to the notification
area; click the icon to bring it back, or right-click it for **Quit and stop
sharing**.

### The one thing Windows will ask

The first time it runs, Windows shows a **Windows Security Alert** asking
whether to allow it through the firewall. Tick both **Private** and **Public**,
then **Allow access**. That needs an administrator click, once, on this machine
only.

That is the entire setup. No network profile changes, no credentials, no
sharing settings, nothing on any other machine.

## On the machine you browse from — Basalt

Run the installer:

```
apps\client\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\Basalt_1.4.6_x64-setup.exe
```

It opens on the pairing screen.

1. It lists the Basalt hosts answering on this network, by name. Click yours.
2. If the host is asking for a PIN, the six digits appear **on the host's
   screen**, next to the name of the device asking. Type them in.

That is the last time you do any of this. From then on the app reconnects on
its own whenever the host is up — including after the router gives the host a
different address, which it finds again by itself.

### What you see once you are in

**Everything is live.** Delete a file on the host in Explorer and it vanishes
here; rename one and the name changes. It works the other way too, and between
two devices at once, because the host reports what the drive actually did
rather than what it was asked to do.

**Continue watching** sits at the top of Movies and TV Series: what you were
in the middle of, how long is left, and one click to carry on. It follows you
between devices, because the position is kept on the host rather than on the
machine that was watching. A series shows one card — the episode you are
actually on — and clicking it resumes that episode rather than starting the
show again.

It works for what plays in the window *and* for what you hand to VLC or
PotPlayer. The second is an estimate: an external player never reports its
position, so the app uses how far through the file it has read, which runs
ahead of the picture by however much the player buffered. Expect to resume
half a minute or so late.

**Movies and TV Series** appear in the sidebar when the host has the library
switched on. Series open into seasons and episodes. Posters are real artwork if
you gave the host a TMDb key, and otherwise ones the app draws from the title —
in which case nothing about your drive is sent anywhere. A film the app is
unsure about is labelled *a guess* rather than filed silently under the wrong
name, and everything stays in **Files** regardless, recognised or not.

A host that has not been given a drive yet is still listed, greyed out and
labelled, rather than left out with no explanation.

## On a phone or tablet — Basalt for Android

Copy the app to the phone and open it:

```
apps\client\src-tauri\gen\android\app\build\outputs\apk\universal\release\app-universal-release.apk
```

It is published as `Basalt-Android.apk`. Android asks, once, to allow
whatever opened it — the browser, or the Files app — to install apps. That
permission is only for installing, and can be switched off again afterwards.
It needs Android 8.0 or later on a 64-bit phone, which is every phone of the
last several years.

Pairing is the same as on a PC: the phone lists the hosts on the Wi-Fi, you
tap yours, and type the PIN the host shows. The phone has to be on the same
Wi-Fi as the host. If the list stays empty, **Enter the address instead** takes
the host's address, as a last resort.

Once in, there are four tabs — **Files**, **Library**, **Recent** and **More** —
along the bottom on a phone, and down the side on a tablet.

- **Tap** a folder to open it, a photo, film or song to play it, and anything
  else for its menu. The **⋮** on each row is the same menu a right-click gives
  on the desktop. **Long-press** to start choosing several.
- **The + button** uploads into the folder you are in: photos and videos from
  the gallery, any files, or a whole folder with everything inside it. Sharing
  from any other app to **Basalt** works too; it offers to upload into the
  folder you open next.
- **Downloads** go to the phone's **Download/Basalt** folder, where every other
  app can see them. **Transfers**, under **More** or on the strip above the
  tabs, opens or shares what has finished.
- **Films** play in the app, full screen, turned to suit the picture. Tap for
  the controls; double-tap the left or right side to skip ten seconds, and
  keep tapping to skip further. Back closes the player. **Play in your
  player** hands the stream to VLC or MX Player instead.
- **Photos** pinch to zoom, swipe to the next, and swipe down to close.
- A transfer or a song carries on with the screen off. A notification says so
  while it does; Android asks once whether Basalt may show one.

**Updates** come from the same place as the desktop's. **More → Check for
updates** downloads the new version, checks it against its published checksum,
and hands it to Android's installer. The first time, Android asks you to allow
Basalt to install apps.

## If something goes wrong

**The client lists no hosts at all**
Check Basalt Host is still running on the other machine — look in the
notification area, not just the taskbar. Both machines have to be on the same
network, and some routers have a "client isolation" or "AP isolation" setting
that stops them talking to each other at all. If the host is running and the
list is still empty, the firewall prompt was probably dismissed; see below.

**It worked yesterday and not today**
This is the case the whole design is built around, and it should just work: the
client finds the host again wherever it has moved to. If it does not, the host
is not running.

**The phone lists no hosts**
The phone has to be on the same Wi-Fi as the host, not on mobile data. Guest
networks usually keep devices apart, as does "AP isolation" on some routers.
**Enter the address instead** on the pairing screen takes the host's address
(it is on the host's window) when discovery cannot get through.

**Android says it cannot install the app or an update**
Android blocks installing from anything it has not been told to trust. Tap
**Settings** on its message, switch on **Allow from this source**, and go back.
An update that Android refuses as a conflict was signed with a different key —
a test build, usually; uninstall it and install the published one.

**"That pairing request has expired"**
Requests last three minutes. Ask again from the client and a fresh number
appears on the host.

**Something will not leave Continue watching**
Hover the card and click the **×** on its corner. Anything watched past 94%
drops out by itself — the last few minutes are credits, and offering to resume
them is worse than offering nothing.

**Posters are missing for some titles**
Only what TMDb recognises gets one; everything else keeps the cover the app
draws. A title it got wrong is usually a parsing problem rather than a TMDb
one — check the name against the shapes below.

**A film is missing from Movies, or filed under the wrong name**
The index reads the path, not the file. `Arrival (2016).mkv` and
`Show/Season 01/S01E01.mkv` are the shapes it knows; something named
`video1.mkv` has nothing to go on and stays in Files. Anything it was unsure
about is marked *a guess*. Extras, trailers, samples and anything under 50 MB
are left out on purpose.

**The host says it is not sharing**
Another copy is probably already running — check the notification area before
starting a second one. The window says so at the top when that is what
happened.

**"This is not the host this device paired with"**
The app is refusing a machine that is not the one you paired with. Either
something else is now at that address, or the host's config file was deleted
and it generated a new identity. If you know why, pair again from Settings.

**The firewall prompt never appeared, or was dismissed**
Run this once on the host machine, in PowerShell **as administrator**:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Basalt Host" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 7742 -Action Allow
```

**A video plays but there is no sound**
Almost always an MKV. The window is Chromium, and Chromium only reads Matroska
in order to support WebM — so it accepts WebM's codecs and silently drops
everything else. An MKV with an ordinary AAC track therefore shows a picture
and no audio, even though the very same AAC inside an MP4 plays perfectly.

The app detects this and says so, and offers **Play in your player**. That
**streams** — the player is handed a local URL and seeks through it with range
requests, so a 3 GB episode starts at once and nothing is written to your disk.

It looks for VLC, mpv, MPC-HC and PotPlayer, wherever they are installed. To
see which one it found:

```bash
basalt.exe player
```

You can also do it from the command line, or get a URL to paste in yourself:

```bash
basalt.exe play "Season 1/Episode 1.mkv"
basalt.exe url "Season 1/Episode 1.mkv"
```

**A video will not open at all**
AVI, MOV and WMV are containers the window cannot read. Same answer: **Play in
your player**.

**"No player found"**
Install VLC or mpv. Until then `basalt url` prints an address you can paste
into anything.

## Without a window

There is a command-line client too, which is the quickest way to tell whether a
problem is the network or the app:

```
target\release\basalt.exe find
target\release\basalt.exe probe 192.168.1.11
target\release\basalt.exe pair 192.168.1.11
target\release\basalt.exe status
target\release\basalt.exe ls
target\release\basalt.exe get films/holiday.mp4 C:\Users\you\Downloads\holiday.mp4
target\release\basalt.exe put C:\Users\you\clip.mp4 films/clip.mp4
```

It drives exactly the same code the app does — `find` is literally the call the
pairing screen makes — so anything that works here works there, and every
failure is printed in full rather than turned into a banner.

`probe` and `pair` still take an address, unlike the app. That is deliberate:
when discovery is the thing that is broken, a tool that depends on discovery
cannot tell you why.

## Where things are kept

| | |
|---|---|
| Host identity, drive and paired devices | `%APPDATA%\Basalt\host.json` on the host |
| The media index | `%APPDATA%\Basalt\library-*.json` on the host, one per drive |
| Downloaded posters | `%APPDATA%\Basalt\art\` on the host |
| Where things were watched to | `%APPDATA%\Basalt\progress-*.json` on the host |
| Paired hosts and their tokens | `%APPDATA%\Basalt\client.json` on the client |
| The same, on a phone | The app's private storage, left out of backups |
| Downloads on a phone | `Download/Basalt/` in the phone's storage |
| The startup entry | `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, value `Basalt Host` |

Deleting the host's file changes its identity, and every device has to pair
again. Both files are worth the same care as a password manager's.

## The old benchmark harness

`basalt-bench.exe` measured whether any of this was worth building. It is not
needed to run Basalt; the numbers it produced are written up in
[`docs/measured-facts.md`](docs/measured-facts.md).
