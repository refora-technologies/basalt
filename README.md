## Overview

**Basalt** by Refora Technologies turns one computer into a private drive for
the whole household. **Basalt Host** runs on the computer with the drive:
Windows or Linux, with a screen or without one, such as a home server, a NAS or
a Raspberry Pi. **Basalt** runs everywhere else, on Windows computers and on
Android phones and tablets. Every device browses the same files, watches the
same library, and picks up where the last one left off.

There is nothing to configure. You choose a drive on the host; on another
device you choose the host from a list and type the PIN it shows. That is the
whole setup. No address is ever typed and no account is made. Devices find the
host by themselves, and keep finding it when the router gives it a different
address, because they recognise the host itself rather than where it happens to
be today.

Nothing leaves your home. There is no Basalt server and no cloud in the design:
the host serves your files to your devices over your own network, encrypted,
and that is all it does.

## Key Features

### Set up once, then forget it

- **Finds itself.** The host announces itself on your network and every device
  lists what it finds. If a network blocks that, a device can be given the
  host's address instead.
- **Nobody joins without your say-so.** A new device shows a PIN to type,
  once. After that it simply connects, and the host can make any device read
  only or remove it.
- **Manage it from your phone.** Let a device manage the host, and it can do
  everything the host's own window does: choose or rename the drive, browse the
  host's folders to share one, let devices in, add profiles and change
  settings.
- **Hosts with no screen.** On a server, a NAS or a Raspberry Pi, Basalt Host
  runs as a background service or in Docker. It shows a one-time setup code;
  the first device to type it manages the host from then on.
- **A drive that comes and goes.** Unplug the host's drive and every device
  says so; plug it back in and it is shared again, with nothing to redo.
- **Keeps itself up to date.** The host installs new versions by itself when
  nothing is playing, and the apps show what changed before they update. Every
  download is checked against its published checksum first.

### Private by design

- **Encrypted, and sure of the host.** Every connection is encrypted, and each
  device remembers the host it paired with, so a different computer at the
  same address is refused rather than trusted.
- **A key for every device.** Each device signs in with its own key, created
  on the device and kept in its security chip when it has one. It never leaves
  the device, so a copy of its settings can't open your drive.
- **Local only.** No account, no cloud, no tracking. Files travel between your
  own devices and nowhere else. The only requests that leave your network are
  the update check, to GitHub, and poster lookups if you turn them on.
- **Careful with what it keeps.** Profile PINs are stored only as slow, salted
  hashes, and repeated wrong guesses lock a profile for longer each time.

### The whole drive, from anywhere in the house

- **Browse everything.** Files, folders, search, copy, move, rename, delete,
  and select several by dragging a box around them.
- **Upload the easy way.** Drop files or whole folders onto the folder you
  want. On a phone, upload from the gallery, any file or a folder, or share to
  Basalt from any other app.
- **Fast and checked.** Transfers are compressed where that helps, batched
  for small files, and checked end to end so every file arrives exactly as it
  was.
- **Live.** A file added, renamed or deleted on the host, by Basalt or anything
  else, reaches every connected device at once.

### Films and series, filed for you

- **Recognised automatically.** Turn it on and the host files the films and
  series on the drive under Movies and TV Series, with seasons and episodes in
  order, and new ones the moment they are copied in. Every film is checked
  against a bundled catalogue of released titles, offline, so screen recordings
  and home videos stay out of Movies.
- **Posters and picture quality.** Optional posters need no API key. Films,
  series and episodes are tagged HD, Full HD, 2K or 4K from the video itself,
  not from its file name.
- **Continue watching.** Resume points live on the host, so a film started on
  the laptop finishes on the phone, and episodes play on to the next one.
- **Photos, music and home videos.** The host finds every photo, song and video
  on the drive, however deep, and sorts each into its own section. Photos are
  laid out by month at their own shape with a viewer that zooms; music is a
  track list by artist and album that plays on; videos show a picture from
  inside them. Thumbnails are made once, on the host, and shared by every
  device.
- **Choose what devices show.** The host decides which sections appear on
  your devices. Hiding one only tidies the list; every file is still in Files.

### A real player

- **Plays what a browser cannot.** Built on **mpv**, on Windows and Android
  alike, so HEVC, HDR, E-AC3, DTS, MKV and the rest play straight from the
  drive, with nothing downloaded first.
- **4K on any phone.** When a device cannot keep up with a film, the host
  converts it to 1080p as it plays, on its graphics where it has them, with
  the sound and subtitles untouched. The player says so while it prepares,
  picks the film up again if the connection drops, and a quality button
  switches back to the original at any time. The host measures how many films
  its computer can convert at once, and converting can be switched off.
- **Subtitles done properly.** Tracks named by language, remembered on or off
  from one video to the next, found anywhere on the drive by the film's or
  episode's name or dropped onto the video, and nudged into sync when they
  drift.
- **Made for the keyboard.** Space to pause, arrow keys to seek and change
  volume, `C` for subtitles, Shift+P and Shift+N for the previous and next
  episode, and `,` and `.` to step one frame at a time. Pausing shows what is
  playing and what comes next.

### Profiles for the household

- **Everyone gets their own.** A profile is a name, a colour and a PIN. Its
  Continue watching and starred files follow it to every device, and "keep me
  signed in" means typing the PIN once per device.
- **Or skip it.** Carry on as the device, with a history of its own.
- **Managed from the host.** See who is signed in where, reset a forgotten PIN,
  or remove a profile along with its history.
- **Bring your profile.** A profile made on one drive can be used on another
  host too, once someone who manages that host lets it in. Its PIN stays on its
  own drive.

### On your phone and tablet

- **The same app, laid out for touch.** Tabs along the bottom on a phone and a
  rail down the side on a tablet; tap to open, long-press to choose several.
- **Films in your hand.** Full screen, turned to suit the picture, with a double
  tap either side to skip. Or hand the stream to another player such as VLC.
- **Photos by touch.** Pinch to zoom, swipe to the next, swipe down to put it
  away.
- **Carries on with the screen off.** A transfer or a song keeps going while
  the phone is locked, and downloads land in the phone's Download folder.
- **Stays on the Wi-Fi.** On a Wi-Fi network without internet access, where a
  phone would normally switch to mobile data, Basalt keeps its connection to
  the host.

### Several devices at once

There is no device limit and no connection limit. The host serves bytes and
nothing more, so more viewers cost it almost nothing.

For Docker, see [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).

The Windows installers install per user and need no administrator rights. They
update an existing installation in place and keep its pairing and settings.

The Android app is not on the Play Store yet. Open the `.apk` on the phone and
allow your browser or file manager to install it when Android asks; that
permission is only for installing, and can be turned off again afterwards.

**Getting started:**

1. Install Basalt Host on the computer with the drive, open it, and choose the
   drive to share.
2. Open Basalt on another device. It lists the host; choose it.
3. Type the PIN the host shows. Done.

**With no screen:** install the package, for example with
`sudo apt install ./Basalt-Host-Server-Linux-amd64.deb`. It finishes by showing
the host's address and a setup code. Open Basalt on your phone or computer,
choose the host marked **new**, and type the code. That device then manages the
host: choose what it shares in **Manage host**. Run `sudo basalt-host status`
to see it all again; the full guide is in
[`packaging/linux/README.md`](packaging/linux/README.md).

Basalt Host updates itself when nothing is playing; you can turn that off in
its settings or in Manage host. The apps check for updates on their own and
show what is in the new version before you install it. On Android the update is
downloaded, checked against its published checksum, and handed to Android's own
installer; the first time, Android asks you to allow Basalt to install it.

## Configuration & Usage

Everything Basalt keeps lives in `%APPDATA%\Basalt\` on Windows,
`~/.config/basalt/` on a Linux desktop, and `/var/lib/basalt-host/` for the
host with no screen:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `host.json` | The host's identity, settings, paired devices and profiles |
| `client.json` | The drive this device is paired with |
| `host.log` | The host's log, replaced at each start |
| `library-*.json`, `collections-*.json` | The media index, rebuilt by a scan |
| `watched-*.json`, `stars-*.json` | Watch history and starred files, per device and per profile |
| `resolutions-*.json` | Each video's measured picture size |
| `thumbs/`, `art/` | Thumbnails, and downloaded posters |

Deleting `host.json` regenerates the host's identity, which un-pairs every
device and removes its profiles. The rest can be deleted freely and is
rebuilt as needed, apart from watch history and stars.

On Android the app keeps what it needs in its own private storage, which is
left out of phone backups, so its pairing never travels to another device.
Clearing the app's storage, or **Forget this drive** under **More**, means
pairing again.

**Optional, and off by default:** recognising films and series reads the whole
drive, and downloading posters sends the titles of recognised films and series
to an online service to find their posters. Neither happens until you turn it
on, in Basalt Host or in Manage host.

## Building from source

```
rustup toolchain install stable          # Rust 1.98+ MSVC
cd apps/client/src-tauri && pwsh -File fetch-libmpv.ps1
cd apps/host/src-tauri   && pwsh -File fetch-libmpv.ps1 && pwsh -File fetch-ffmpeg.ps1
cd apps/client && npm install && npx tauri build
cd apps/host   && npm install && npx tauri build
```

`fetch-libmpv.ps1` downloads libmpv and a small wrapper into `src-tauri/lib/`
and verifies the wrapper's checksum. They are not in the repository because
`libmpv-2.dll` is 96 MB. The host uses the same libmpv to make thumbnails of
videos; its script copies the client's rather than downloading it again.

`fetch-ffmpeg.ps1` puts ffmpeg into the host's `src-tauri/lib/`, checked
against the checksum its builder publishes. The host uses it to convert video
for a device that cannot play a file itself.

The host recognises films against a catalogue of every film and series title
on Wikidata, bundled so that it works offline and sends nothing anywhere. It is
committed at `crates/basalt-catalog/data/catalog.bin` (about 3 MB) and rebuilt
for each release with:

```
cargo run -p catalog-build --release
```

`cargo test --all` runs the Rust suite; `npm test` in either app runs its own.

### Linux packages

On Linux with Docker:

```
packaging/build-desktop-linux.sh OUT_DIR   # Basalt Host with a window: .deb, .rpm, AppImage
packaging/build-server.sh OUT_DIR          # with no screen: .deb, .rpm, .tar.gz, amd64 and arm64
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t basalt-host .
```

Each builds inside an older system's container, so what it makes runs on
Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 11 and everything newer.

### The Android app

It needs the Android SDK with NDK 28, JDK 17, and Rust's Android targets:

```
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android i686-linux-android
set NDK_HOME=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\ndk\28.2.13676358
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17
cd apps/client && npx tauri android build --apk --target aarch64
```

The phone's player is mpv too, from the `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` package, which
Gradle fetches by itself; the desktop's Windows libraries are left out.

Release builds are signed with a key kept outside the repository. Gradle reads
its location and passwords from
`%USERPROFILE%\.basalt\android-signing\keystore.properties`, or from the file
`BASALT_SIGNING` names:

```
storeFile=D:/path/to/basalt-release.keystore
storePassword=...
keyAlias=basalt
keyPassword=...
```

Without it the build is left unsigned. Keep the key safe: Android installs an
update only over an app signed with the same key.

`npx tauri android build --debug --apk --target x86_64` builds for the
emulator. After regenerating icons with `npx tauri icon`, run
`python tools/make-icons.py` again so the Android project has its own.
