//! Basalt client shell, for Windows and Android.
//!
//! A thin layer of commands over [`basalt_client::Basalt`]. Everything with
//! any judgement in it lives in that crate, where it can be tested against a
//! real host in one process; this file only translates between Tauri's world
//! and that API.
//!
//! The window is frameless because the app draws its own title bar (see
//! `TitleBar.tsx`), and **transparent** — not for any visual effect, but
//! because that is how video gets on screen. libmpv renders into the native
//! window behind the webview, so the page has to be able to get out of its
//! way. `body` stays opaque, so nothing about the app looks any different;
//! only the player makes itself see-through, and mpv shows through the hole.
