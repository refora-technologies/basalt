/**
 * Turning release notes into something worth reading in the app.

 * `**There is nothing to configure.**` — which reads worse than no notes at
 * all, because it looks like the app is broken rather than terse.
 *
 * Deliberately not a Markdown library. What release notes actually use is
 * headings, bullets, bold and the odd `code` span; a parser for that is
 * forty lines, and a dependency for it is a parser for tables, footnotes and
 * HTML embedding — none of which should render inside a settings panel
 * anyway.
