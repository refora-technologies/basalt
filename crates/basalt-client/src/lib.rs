//! Basalt client.

//! The half that runs on the machine doing the browsing: pairing, a pool of
//! authenticated connections, transfers with progress and resume, and a local
//! HTTP proxy so a media player can seek through a file on the host as if it
//! were local.
//!
//! Nothing here knows about a user interface. The Tauri shell is a thin layer
//! of commands over [`Basalt`], which is what lets the whole client be tested
//! against a real host in one process.
