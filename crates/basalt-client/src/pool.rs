//! A small pool of connections to one host.
//!
//! The reason this exists rather than a single shared connection: the protocol
//! is strictly request-then-response, so a 2 GB download would own the
//! connection for a minute and a half and the folder list would sit there
//! waiting. Opening a second connection costs nothing — Phase 0 measured 1
//! stream at 20.8 MB/s and 16 at 24.1, essentially flat — so the fix for
//! head-of-line blocking is simply not to share the line.
//!
//! Four is the cap: one for browsing, one for the transfer in progress, and
//! two spare for the media player's range requests, which want to seek while
//! something else is running.
