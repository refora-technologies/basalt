//! The shapes the interface receives.
//!
//! These live here rather than in the Tauri shell for one reason: the shell is
//! outside the Cargo workspace, so nothing in it is covered by `cargo test` or
//! by the pre-commit hook. A field renamed here and not in `api.ts` would
//! produce an app that runs, connects, and shows nothing — with no test
//! anywhere to catch it.
//!
//! **Every struct here is `camelCase` on the wire.** Tauri converts command
//! *arguments* from JavaScript's camelCase to Rust's snake_case automatically,
//! but it does not touch what comes back: a response is serialised exactly as
//! serde declares it. So `host_id` would arrive in JavaScript as `host_id`
//! while `api.ts` reads `hostId`, and every field would silently be
//! `undefined`. The tests below exist to make that impossible to reintroduce.
