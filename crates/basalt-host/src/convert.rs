//! Video converted as it is watched, for a device that cannot play the file.
//!
//! A phone whose hardware decoder stops at 1440p cannot play a 4K episode:
//! decoded in software it managed eight frames a second and fell seconds
//! behind its sound. The host converts it instead, as it is watched: the
//! picture becomes 1080p H.264, which every phone decodes in hardware, while
//! the sound and the subtitles are copied across untouched. Nothing is written
//! to disk; ffmpeg's output goes straight down the connection.
//!
//! **The machine does the work it is built for.** A graphics chip has a video
//! engine that decodes and encodes far faster than its processor can, and
//! uses little power doing it. So the fastest route this machine has is
//! tried first, and the next if it fails:
//!
//! 1. NVIDIA, decoding, scaling and encoding on the card.
//! 2. Intel Quick Sync, the same on the processor's graphics.
//! 3. Decoding on the graphics, scaling in software, encoding on whichever
//!    encoder there is (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD).
//! 4. Software throughout, which a modern processor can manage for one stream
//!    and an old one cannot.
//!
//! A route that fails does so in the first moments, before any picture has
//! been sent, so falling through costs a second at most. The one that worked
//! is remembered and tried first next time.
//!
//! **Times stay the film's own.** A conversion starts where it is asked to,
//! and keeps the film's timestamps, so a player showing it says 41:30 at
//! 41:30, and seeking further is a new conversion from there.
//!
//! **ffmpeg is found, not assumed.** Beside the host, or downloaded into the
//! host's own folder, or on the computer's path; without it the host says it
//! cannot convert and the device plays the file as best it can.
