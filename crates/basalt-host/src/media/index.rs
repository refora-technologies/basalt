//! The library: what a scan found, and how it changes when the drive does.
//!
//! Rebuilt from scratch on every scan rather than patched incrementally, and
//! that is the whole answer to "remove what is no longer there". A scan
//! produces the complete truth about the drive; anything absent from it is gone
//! by construction. Incremental removal would mean maintaining a second idea of
//! what exists and keeping it in step, which is exactly the kind of bookkeeping
//! that drifts.
//!
//! What *is* preserved across a rebuild is everything a person contributed —
//! artwork fetched, and later their corrections — keyed by an id derived from
//! the title rather than the path. So reorganising a drive keeps the poster.
//!
//! Stored as JSON beside the host's config. A personal library is thousands of
//! items, and the whole index is a few hundred kilobytes; a database earns its
//! place at a scale this will not reach. (A mirrored SQLite index was cut from
//! this project once before, for mirroring *every file*. This is not that: it
//! holds derived metadata for media only.)
