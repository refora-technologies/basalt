//! The shapes the host's interface receives.
//!
//! Here rather than in the Tauri shell for the same reason as the client's
//! equivalent: the shell is outside the Cargo workspace, so nothing in it is
//! covered by `cargo test` or the pre-commit hook. A field renamed here and not
//! in the interface would produce an app that runs and shows nothing, with no
//! test anywhere to catch it.
//!
//! **Every struct here is `camelCase` on the wire.** Tauri converts command
//! *arguments* from camelCase to snake_case automatically; it does nothing to
//! what comes back. `token_hash` would arrive in JavaScript as `token_hash`
//! while the interface reads `tokenHash`, and every field would silently be
//! `undefined`. The tests at the bottom assert the exact key set of each, so
//! that cannot be reintroduced quietly.
