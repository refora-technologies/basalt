//! Uploads in progress.
//!
//! An upload writes to a temporary file beside its destination and is renamed
//! into place only after its BLAKE3 matches. Two things follow from that, and
//! both matter on a Wi-Fi link that drops:
//!
//! - A failed or abandoned upload never replaces a good file. The worst case is
//!   a `.part` file left behind, not a truncated original.
//! - Resuming is just reopening the temporary file and reading its length, so
//!   it survives the host restarting and not only the connection dropping.
//!
//! The temporary file sits next to the destination rather than in a scratch
//! directory so that the final step is a rename within one volume, which is
//! atomic. A rename across volumes is a copy, and a copy of a 2 GB film at the
//! end of an upload would be both slow and a second chance to fail.
//!
//! **Kept open, and hashed as it arrives.** Each chunk used to reopen the
//! temporary file, write, and close it again — a file open and close per four
//! megabytes, which on Windows is also where antivirus gets to look — and the
//! whole file was read back at the end to hash it, which is the pause at 100%
//! on a large upload. Now each upload holds its file open and hashes each chunk
//! as it lands, and each has a lock of its own, so two uploads no longer wait
//! on each other's disk writes.
