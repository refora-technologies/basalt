//! Watching the drive, so nobody is ever looking at a stale listing.
//!
//! The filesystem is the truth. Not the host's record of what it did — the
//! filesystem. A file deleted in Explorer, overwritten by another program, or
//! renamed by a second client all arrive here through the same door, which
//! means there is no class of change that quietly fails to propagate. Reporting
//! the host's *own* operations instead would have been simpler and would have
//! been wrong exactly when it mattered.
//!
//! Two things make this usable rather than a firehose:
//!
//! - **Coalescing.** Writing one file emits a burst of events; copying a folder
//!   emits thousands. Events are collected for [`SETTLE`] and deduplicated
//!   before anyone hears about them.
//! - **A ceiling.** Unpacking an archive can produce more changes than any
//!   client wants listed. Past [`MAX_BATCH`] the whole batch collapses into a
//!   single [`Change::Resynchronise`], which says "reload, I stopped counting"
//!   rather than dropping events and leaving clients subtly wrong.
