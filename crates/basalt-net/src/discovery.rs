//! Finding hosts on the local network.
//!
//! The point of this module is that **an address is never something a person
//! types, and never something that is remembered.** What a client remembers is
//! the host's public key. Reconnecting means asking the network who is there
//! and connecting to whichever machine presents the key that was pinned. The
//! router can hand out a different address every day and nothing notices.
//!
//! That also settles how much this protocol has to be trusted, which is: not at
//! all. Anything on the network can send a reply claiming to be a Basalt host,
//! and it will fail the TLS pin check a moment later. Discovery is a hint about
//! **where to look**, never a statement about **who to trust**. Nothing secret
//! travels here — the host id is a public key hash, published deliberately.
//!
//! ```text
//! query   [magic "BSLTd"][version u8][nonce u64 LE]
//! reply   [magic "BSLTd"][version u8][nonce u64 LE][JSON]
//! ```
//!
//! Hosts answer queries *and* announce themselves unprompted every few seconds.
//! A machine with virtual adapters — VMware, Hyper-V, WSL — does not always
//! route a broadcast the way you would hope, so the client both asks and
//! listens.
//!
//! Written rather than using mDNS: mDNS means a dependency, a responder
//! competing with the one Windows already runs, and a great deal of protocol
//! for the question "who is out there". This is the same reasoning that
//! produced the file protocol.
