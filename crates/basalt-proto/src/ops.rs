//! Operation codes and the request/response envelope.
//!
//! The envelope is the one Phase 0 measured, unchanged:
//!
//! ```text
//! request   [op u8][len u32 LE][payload len bytes]
//! response  [status u8][len u64 LE][payload len bytes]
//! ```
//!
//! Requests carry a 32-bit length because they are manifests and paths; a
//! response carries 64 because it may be a film. The split is deliberate — it
//! means a corrupt request length cannot ask for a terabyte of allocation.
//!
//! The framing itself lives in `basalt-net`, which has tokio. This module is
//! kept synchronous and dependency-light so the protocol vocabulary can be
//! tested without a runtime.
